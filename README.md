# steem-compare

Steem Compare allows you to easily see account information on multiple accounts at once. Enter a comma separated list or add users individually. [View the live site here](https://code-with-sam.github.io/steem-compare/index.html#)

# setup 
If you would like to setup this project locally
```
git clone https://github.com/code-with-sam/steem-compare/

# Dev
There are currently no build tools or pre-processing in use so you can edid main.css/main.js directly and refresh in the browser to see updates.

# Dependecies 
- [steem-js](https://github.com/drov0/steemsnippets/tree/master/steemjs)

# Upcoming updates ->
A couple features spring to mind to add next -
- filtering after search e.g ( over 50rep, less than 1000sp)
- Highlighting if powering down.
- if the user is re-investing or sending to exchange.
- if the user uses upvote accounts
- minify assets
- refactor code into modules

I would also like to bring in some extra information perhaps -
- Average Weekly rewards
- latest rewards
- Average user engagement

# V0.2

- Responsive Updates sm + lg fixes
- New Metric - Relative Account Age
